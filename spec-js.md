# Custom Web Part II: This Feels Scripted

Use your framework from the last lab and add a JavaScript file to it for additional functionality.

## Requirements:

- All code must be original and yours, ideas can come from the internet but not code
- All styling should come from the SASS files (alter files as needed) 
- Making modifications to tools should never require messing with the code, use css classes or JSON files if needed
- Tools to add:
	- Add navigation tool with drop-downs, colors and styling should be handled by your SASS files
	- Add the ability to easily create a modal (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto\_css\_modals.asp)
	- Add a responsive slideshow with appropriately styled buttons to go forward and back and an indicator to show which image you are on
	- Add a message, quote, or tip of the day that reads content from a JSON file
	- Add two other USEFUL JavaScript tools or features that enhance the overall framework and are NOT cheesy or unprofessional (this is NOT Intro to Web)
- Update your documentation website to include these new features

## Submission:

One zip file containing the html pages at the top level and four directories for other files: images, less (or sass), css, scripts
