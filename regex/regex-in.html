The <code><dfn>dfn</dfn></code> tag is used to indicate a term being defined.
The nearest ancestor that is one of <code>p</code>,
<code>dt</code>/<code>dd</code>, or <code>section</code> is considered to be
the definition of the term.

Think of <code>mark</code> as a highlighter (but not in a stylish way!). Use it
to mark up text that has <mark>particular relevance</mark> to the surrounding
content, as you would if you were highlighting notes while styding for an exam.

Think of <code>small</code> as a "fine print" tag. It's not to be used just to
change font size; it's meant for things like copyright notices or legal text.

The <code>strong</code> tag should be used for text that bears particular
importance, such as a warning. For a comparison of similar tags, see the
<a href="#Bring_attention_to">Bring attention to</a> element.
<strong>Do not use this tag simply for styling.</strong>

<p>
The subscript and superscript tags mark up text that should be subscripted or
superscripted solely for reasons of compliance with typographical conventions.
For example, it is appropriate to use <code>sub</code> when writing
H<sub>2</sub>O, and <code>sup</code> for writing
<var>a</var><sup>2</sup> + <var>b</var><sup>2</sup> = <var>c</var><sup>2</sup>,
but neither when writing
L<span style="vertical-align: text-bottom;">A</span>
T<span style="vertical-align: text-top;">E</span>X.

<code>u</code> used to stand for "underline", and as such was deprecated in
HTML4. However, for some reason, it's back in HTML5 with a shiny new semantic
meaning: unarticulated annotation. For the life of me, I can't figure out what
that really means. MDN's
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/u">
